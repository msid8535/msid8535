        description: "I solidified my security foundations by completing the elective “Principles of Security and Security Engineering,” where I explored the many facets of digital and networked security, the challenges IT systems face, and the core design principles behind resilient architectures. The unit’s hands‑on approach—practicing state‑of‑the‑art security programming, usability in security, operational security, and cyber‑physical systems—prepared me to tackle real‑world threats and unforeseen challenges. Beyond the classroom, I’m passionate about staying abreast of industry trends in vulnerability research and penetration testing, and I’m committed to integrating strong security practices throughout the software development lifecycle.",
